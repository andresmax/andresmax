29 Jan 20</div><h1 class=font-normal>The 30 Day Linux Challenge</h1><img id=post-image src=https://www.andresmax.com//images/fedora31desk.jpg><p>I challenged myself to drop Mac and Windows and use Linux only for 30 days. Here&rsquo;s what I learned.</p><p>I got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T74Lg9Isv-8">Lenovo laptop back in December</a>, I installed Linux as soon as I got it.</p><p>Why? I got sick of my Macbooks breaking down for one reason or another and I planned to use it for development mostly and some daily work.</p><p>So I went to the darkside for comfort.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve always been comfortable using Linux as a development environment, but not as a daily driver. My story with Linux began in 1998 when I downloaded Redhat Linux and tested it out.</p><p>Back then, and for many years things weren&rsquo;t so polished. In my experience: Linux was great for servers and development, terrible for the desktop.</p><p>However, over the years I have seen some mayor Linux distros (Ubuntu, Fedora to name two) become polished and usable as desktop OS&rsquo;s.</p><p>The fact that companies like Lenovo, Dell and many others now ship Linux for consumer products out of the box, says a lot.</p><p>My relationship with platforms over the years has been mixed:</p><ul><li><strong>1998-2008</strong> Windows only (some Linux)</li><li><strong>2008-2016</strong> Hardcore Apple fanboy</li><li><strong>2016-2019</strong> Apple/Windows (Gaming got me into building a PC, turned into my favorite place to work. Sitting upright > arching over a laptop)</li></ul><p>For some reason I ended up trying Fedora Linux again and was very impressed by the polish of the UI, responsiveness and how easy everything was to set up and get productive.</p><p>So I gave myself a challenge: go Linux only for 30 days for everything I do: all of my work, design, development, gaming and hobbies (3d Printing and IoT).</p><p>If it didn&rsquo;t cut the bill, back to Win on my desktop and a Macbook.</p><p>To my surprise it wen&rsquo;t incredibly well. So well in fact, I no longer have Windows installed in my main desktop PC.</p><h2 id=6-things-ive-learned>6 Things I&rsquo;ve learned</h2><ol><li><p><strong>It&rsquo;s fast</strong> - My desktop PC has latest gen hardware, but my laptop does not. Fedora Linux is equally fast on both. Apps launch almost instantly. The memory footprint is very low.</p></li><li><p><strong>You get freedom of choice</strong> - This came to me as a surprise: I&rsquo;ve become used to Apple/Microsoft&rsquo;s walled gardens, where they get to decide what apps you can install and either shove them down your face or developers charge you a recurring subscription fee for the most basic of apps. You have none of that in Linux using Open source software.</p></li><li><p><strong>Respects your privacy</strong> - No telemetry, no ads, no bloatware, no apps sneakily sending user data somewhere. Need I say more?</p></li><li><p><strong>You save money</strong> - You don&rsquo;t have to pay Adobe, Apple, MS and numerous developers subcription fees to get basic work done. I had gotten used to paying monthly fees for things as basic photo and text editing.</p></li><li><p><strong>It&rsquo;s fun</strong> - This also came as as surprise: Linux has made it fun again to sit down, get work done and build stuff. I&rsquo;ve built in just a few short weeks better workflows, scripts and tools that help me work more efficiently, while having fun doing it.</p></li><li><p><strong>It&rsquo;s gorgeous</strong> - Mac OS&rsquo;s interface is beautiful. Windows 10&rsquo;s is not. With a nice wallpaper and enabling proper font support Fedora&rsquo;s interface (Gnome DE) is absolutely gorgeous.</p></li></ol><p><a href=/images/fedora31desk.jpg><img src=/images/fedora31desk.jpg alt="My current desktop"></a></p><h2 id=not-for-everyone>Not for everyone</h2><p>I&rsquo;m not about to turn into a Linux advocate and start dissing Apple or Microsoft. I truly believe they have some good products. So none of that here.</p><p>I also understand that Linux in many of it&rsquo;s flavors is not for everyone.</p><p>But if you are a geek, developer, tinkerer, maker, then you will feel right at home and I highly encourage you to give Fedora a try.</p><h2 id=after-the-first-30-days>After the first 30 days</h2><p>The few times I did boot back into Windows during my 30 day challenge, I was eager to get out of there ASAP. For me it has a lot to do with the fact that I found a distro that ticked all the boxes (including a beautiful, polished interface).</p><p>I will still be in the Apple ecosystem - I have my iPhone and a Macmini at Ideaware, and I think iCloud is great.</p><p>Windows is no longer installed in my main desktop PC, and I&rsquo;m happy about that.</p><p>For the foreseable future, I will keep running Linux at home and on my laptop. I&rsquo;m more productive, and it has made computing fun again.</p><hr><a href="https://twitter.com/share?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class=twitter-share-button data-show-count=false>Tweet</a><script async src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script></article></main><div id=mc_embed_signup><form action="https://ideaware.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=189d4840912da70e187111ca7&id=026e9266f9" method=post id=mc-embedded-subscribe-form name=mc-embedded-subscribe-form class="m-2 flex justify-center validate" target=_blank novalidate><div id=mc_embed_signup_scroll><input type=email name=EMAIL class="p-3 w-60 sm:w-80 md:w-80 sm:w-72 mr-2 text-sm focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-600 rounded-sm" id=mce-EMAIL placeholder=your@email.com required><div style=position:absolute;left:-5000px aria-hidden=true><input type=text name=b_189d4840912da70e187111ca7_026e9266f9 tabindex=-1></div><input type=submit value=Subscribe name=subscribe id=mc-embedded-subscribe class="font-medium cursor-pointer p-3 text-white text-sm bg-red-500 rounded-sm hover:bg-red-700"></div></form></div><footer class="w-full text-center p-4 pin-b text-xs text-gray-400 mt-10"><p><a class="px-1 capitalize text-base text-gray-800 font-medium hover:text-red-500" href=https://instagram.com/andresmax>instagram</a>
