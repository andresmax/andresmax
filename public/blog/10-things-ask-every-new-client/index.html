30 Jul 14</div><h1 class=font-normal>Top 10 Questions To Ask Your Next Design Client</h1><p>New projects and clients are always usually exciting. The possibilities are endless, the hair-pulling feedback limitless!</p><p>It&rsquo;s your time to shine, to design that great new interface that will bring world peace. But before you prepare your nobel prize speech, make sure you understand what problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve.</p><p>Defining the problem and what your client needs will make the difference between a successful project (and a happy client) and just a nice screenshot you will add to your dribbble profile.</p><p>Through the years I&rsquo;ve perfected a list of  ten questions that I ask every new client at <a href=http://ideaware.co>Ideaware</a>:</p><p><strong>1. Why are you commissioning this project?</strong> When a new client approaches you it is because they have a need, pain or problem. It may seem like an obvious question but sometimes your client hasn&rsquo;t given it any thought. Asking this question will get both of you aligned on needs and expectation.</p><p><strong>2. What are the primary goals of this project?</strong> One of my favorite things to ask, you get to set expectations right off the bat. Try to aim for specific answers like: &ldquo;Update the look and feel of our app to iOS7 and have it in the Appstore by June&rdquo;. Work together on a better answer if all you&rsquo;re getting is: &ldquo;We want to make it prettier&rdquo;. This is a red flag since there is no way to benchmark &ldquo;pretty&rdquo;.</p><p><strong>3. Who are your users?</strong> Always, ALWAYS keep in mind mind who you&rsquo;re designing for. It makes a world of difference if you&rsquo;re designing something aimed for a tech-savvy teen rather than a 60-year old woman trying to find a lower price on a prescription. This difference will probably affect the overall project scope and help you give the client a better quote.</p><p><strong>4. Who are your competitors?</strong> Get a grasp of who your client (and ultimately your design) is up against. If your client doesn&rsquo;t know the answer, time to do some research. Don&rsquo;t settle for &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s something like this out there!&rdquo;. Trust me, there is someone else out there solving almost exactly the same thing.</p><p><strong>5. Any sites, apps, etc. that inspire you?</strong> By the time the client is talking to you, they already have a good idea of what they want. You&rsquo;ll save yourself endless proposals and feedback loops if you get aligned with their vision right from the start. Aim for specific websites, apps, links and don&rsquo;t settle for &ldquo;clean and lots of pictures.&rdquo;. I always find useful creating a private Pinterest mood board to post stuff together.</p><p><strong>6. Do you have a brand style guide?</strong> Having a brand style guide (if the client has one) will help you with fonts, colors, images, etc. that you will need to create a better, brand-aligned design for your client. If the client doesn&rsquo;t have one, this might be a good time to talk brand tone, colors and preferred fonts.</p><p><strong>7. What is your marketing or monetization goal?</strong> Most of the time your client will have business goals in mind. They&rsquo;re talking to you to help them get there. Ask what their goals are. Is it to drive website conversions? Get a million app downloads? Find Waldo? The answer will completely shape the design.</p><p><strong>8. Do you have content/assets for this project?</strong> I make it a rule of thumb to not start a project unless we have enough content, assets and anything else we might need. <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content#Content_is_king>Content is king</a>, and you should always know what content you&rsquo;re designing for and with. Assets like pictures, videos, audio, etc are very important, so make sure to ask for them (or if you need to buy/find them yourself).</p><p><strong>9. What is your anticipated deadline for the project?</strong> Love this one. You get such a variety of answers like &ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t know, sometime next year?&rdquo; or my all-time favorite that goes something like &ldquo;In the next two weeks we need to go live!&rdquo;. Once again is all about expectations, be sure to set them. Do you have the time and resources? Is the client being realistic?</p><p><strong>10. What is your budget? (Or my rates are $X)</strong> Possibly the most important question on the list. You&rsquo;ll save a lot of your (and the client&rsquo;s) time by setting budget expectations. Nothing wrong with asking the client. Sometimes the client will just shoot the question back, I&rsquo;ll just give them a sense of pricing and timeline. Once again, it&rsquo;s all about expectations.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong> You can save yourself a lot of time and kick off a project right if you ask the right questions. These are the ones that help me see if a client is fit to work with <a href=http://ideaware.co>Ideaware</a>, I really hope you find them useful too.</p><hr><a href="https://twitter.com/share?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class=twitter-share-button data-show-count=false>Tweet</a><script async src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script></article></main><div id=mc_embed_signup><form action="https://ideaware.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=189d4840912da70e187111ca7&id=026e9266f9" method=post id=mc-embedded-subscribe-form name=mc-embedded-subscribe-form class="m-2 flex justify-center validate" target=_blank novalidate><div id=mc_embed_signup_scroll><input type=email name=EMAIL class="p-3 w-60 sm:w-80 md:w-80 sm:w-72 mr-2 text-sm focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-600 rounded-sm" id=mce-EMAIL placeholder=your@email.com required><div style=position:absolute;left:-5000px aria-hidden=true><input type=text name=b_189d4840912da70e187111ca7_026e9266f9 tabindex=-1></div><input type=submit value=Subscribe name=subscribe id=mc-embedded-subscribe class="font-medium cursor-pointer p-3 text-white text-sm bg-red-500 rounded-sm hover:bg-red-700"></div></form></div><footer class="w-full text-center p-4 pin-b text-xs text-gray-400 mt-10"><p><a class="px-1 capitalize text-base text-gray-800 font-medium hover:text-red-500" href=https://instagram.com/andresmax>instagram</a>
