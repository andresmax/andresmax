About a year ago, I was in Miami with the team working with a client from LA. Just before we left he walked up to me and said: "Max, you're the James Bond of web design. You travel around the world saving one product at a time. Thank you." He didn't realize how much his words meant to me - and probably hasn't to this day. It was at that moment that I realized I was doing things right, that's the exact reason on why I started the agency. There should _always_ be a reason on why we're doing what we're doing. And equally important that reason needs to be _measurable_. What's your reason? Why are you doing it?
