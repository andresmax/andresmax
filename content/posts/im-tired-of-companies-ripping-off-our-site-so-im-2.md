Late last year we redesigned and launched our new site at [http://ideaware.co](http://ideaware.co), we got lots of great reviews and published in many blogs.

Recently, I’ve noticed a lot of weird traffic sources on Google Analytics and upon further inspection (and to my shock) our site has been blatantly copied many times. 

Check some of them out:

[http://www.smipropellers.com](http://www.smipropellers.com)

[http://www.revoblue.com](http://www.revoblue.com)

… to name a few. Worst thing is most of them claim to be designers, software and digital agencies!

This is just ridiculous, what makes people think they can just rip off your work for free? Not sure how to proceed here. 

Edit: Wow this went viral fast.

Edit 2: Thanks for the support HackerNewser’s!

Edit 3: People have been sending me even more sites, here are a few:
