So long Wordpress, and thanks for all the fish.

<!--more-->

This blog has gone wordpress-free!

Wordpress has been my go to CMS for all my sites for, _erm, 12 years maybe?_ , and during that time I've watched it turn into a bloated mess of a CMS-platform-ecosystem thing.

The constant hacking of the platform.

The endless spam messages.

The slowness.

For a while I've been meaning to move my site into something much more simpler, static and markdown based. Hadn't done much research really, until a few days back I came across [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Instant click.

It took about 5 hours of hacking away and here we are, all migrated into a faster site that I can tweak extremely easily to my liking.

**5 hours**. Not a week coding or tweaking a theme, plugins, hosting, etc.

If you're on the same boat as me, I highly encourage you to try Hugo in your machine.

Here's the video that got me into migrating: [Wordpress is Dead | Static Sites are the future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JaBian3vgI)

And some easy to follow reading material: [Switching From WordPress to Hugo](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/05/switch-wordpress-hugo/)

Now all I do is write in my favorite editor (Atom FTW), tweak and push to Github. Done!

You can find the public code for this site and template in my [Github repo](https://github.com/andresmax/andresmax) if you want to use it.

I publish on [YouTube][1] and [andresmax.com][2], you can also listen to my podcast on entrepreneurship and life at [anchor.fm/andresmax][3]
