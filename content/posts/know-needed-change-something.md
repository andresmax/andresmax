My all time favorite quote was said by Steve Jobs back in 2005 during his Stanford speech:

> "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "no" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something."

I recently had to make a tough career/personal decision, and this quote held true as it always does for me. Simply said, if you're not happy with your current life or professional situation, you need to change something. Change is usually not easy, but no one is going to do it for you. It's a path you need to decide to walk. Your life is yours. Your happiness is too. If you're waking up feeling miserable too many days in a row, time for a change. I'm constantly assessing my current situation and state of happiness with what I'm doing and bring changes accordingly. Everything, absolutely everything around you is within your grasp to either change or just eliminate from your life. We all have the power to change our reality.
