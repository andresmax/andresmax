The holidays are officially now over, and aside from me working on a new app I also worked on my blog.

<!--more-->

This blog is 9 years old with only a handful of articles written by me. Looking at my content I had around 462 articles, out of which 24 where me own. Most of them were just shared content. No biggie, thatâ€™s what I used to use my blog for. Now I am a [YouTube Superstar](http://youtube.com/andresmax) ðŸ¤£. And I have a ton of stuff I want to share with software founders and aspiring entrepreneurs.

### Changes made

*   Deleted around 442 old articles dating back from 2010.
*   New theme and layout to simplify navigation
*   Awesome emojis all around

### Can you help me in the comments?

*   How can I improve your experience here?
*   What content would you like me to post?

Of course you will be seeing my YouTube videos x-posted here. _Rock on._
