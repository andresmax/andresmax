Sorry Forbes, I disagree.

I disagree, here are my 10 reasons why you SHOULD consider a side hustle, in the same order:

> 1. 'A Mile Wide And An Inch Deep'

Nope, side projects help you learn new things, connect with other mindsets and in the long tern, help you grow.

> 2. 'Flywheel' Blindness

Nope, keeping various projects going increases your chance of success.

> 3. The Wrong Side Of The Snowball Effect

You can align many of your projects or ideas towards the same goals. Just different ways to get there.

> 4. Limiting Your Time Learning

Huh? Having side projects HELPS you learn as you venture into the unknown.

> 5. Limiting Your Time To Recharge

Side hustles actually help you disconnect from the grind. Just find a fun one!

> 6. Diversification Isnâ€™t Always The Fastest Way To Succeed

Keep. them. focused. on. your. main. goal.

> 7. Losing Team Buy-In

Be there for your team. They don't actually need you 24/7.

> 8. Investors Will Shy Away

Most ventures start like a side hustles. I know all of mine did. I don't have investors, not looking for any. But hey.

> 9. Losing Your Competitive Edge

Again, focus your hustles on your main goals. Where do you want to be 5 years from now? What is it that makes you stand out? Focus your efforts around that.

> 10. The Curse Of A Branch To Swing To

Keep your main business/company/hustle going, make sure it is stable, brings income and growth. Also work on new opportunities.
