Holding on to situations for as long as we can is a source of pain in our lives.

<!--more-->

Change is inevitable, yet we hold on to situations with all we can to delay change. Change means stepping out of the comfort zone, of what we are used to. And that causes pain.

Our brains are naturally wired to avoid pain. So we reject change at all costs.

Even if it is a good change. We are always skeptical. It is worse if change brings along a situation that we do not like.

Truth of the matter is, a lot of what happens in our lives is out of our control.

And we need to accept that.

Accept that change is what our lives are all about, we need to become Pros at adapting.

Embracing.

Letting go of situations and making the best of what is put in front of us.

Letting go of our self inflicted pain because we reject change.

By doing so, we turn bad situations into opportunities. Opportunities to grow, to build a better life for ourselves and those around us.

Next time a big change happens in your life, embrace it and find the opportunities that are being laid in front of you.

More often than not, there are lessons involved that lead to a better life.
