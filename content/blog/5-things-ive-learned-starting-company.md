As far as I know there is no holy grail of things you should do to make a company successful.

Follow your intuition, your passion, be true to yourself and others and most importantly [surround yourself with the right people](https://andresmax.com/youre-average-five-people-spend-time/ "Youâ€™re The Average Of The Five People You Spend Most Time With").

But every know and then you realize there's something worth remembering. Here's five things I always keep in the back of my head: **You have to give it 110%** You have to work & hustle, period. There are no shortcuts, you can learn to delegate but everyone depends on you.

**It's a marathon, not a race** No such thing as overnight success, keep at it.

**You will mess up** I used to beat myself up every time I messed up. Then you just realize we're all human and make mistakes. Embrace your mistakes and hold yourself accountable.

**You will fail** You will fail, a lot. It's part of getting somewhere, there is no golden path. We all need to walk the wrong path to realize it's not the right one.

**Don't worry too much about competition** I never obsessed too much about competition. It's a good thing. But I see some of my colleagues obsessing too much, it's almost sickening. You have to stop, focus on what you're doing.
