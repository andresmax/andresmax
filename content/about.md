## 👋 Hi, I’m Andrés Max
# Founder, strategist, mentor, ux designer, developer.

I’ve always loved great visual design and building software. That led me to become a Software Engineer and UX Designer. 10 years ago I quit my job and started [Ideaware](https://ideaware.co).

Since then I’ve founded multiple SaaS products. Currently, I help software founders scale nearshore software teams.

I believe you can achieve success by also living a calm and happy life.
