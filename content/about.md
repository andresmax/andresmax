## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m AndrÃ©s Max
# Software founder, designer, developer, tinkerer.


Since 2006 Iâ€™ve had the privilege of strategizing, designing, and shipping web and mobile software products. Iâ€™ve built and led teams ranging in size from 1 to 100+ for startup and big companies in tech. In fact it's what currently do as founder at [Ideaware](https://ideaware.co).

Iâ€™ve also founded multiple SaaS products and help other founders do so.

I believe you can achieve success by also living a calm and happy life.
